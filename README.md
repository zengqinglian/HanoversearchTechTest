Java Programming Exercise - Unattended

Following report from a primary school is available to you

Name Age Maths Science English

Oliver 6 A B B Amelia 7 B B A Jack 8 A A C Charlie 8 D D D Harry 9 E D E Jacob 9 A B D George 5 C B B Olivia 6 C C A Noah 7 C A A Oscar 8 B D E James 6 A A B Jessica 8 A A A David 9 E E A Mia 9 E D B

Sophia 7 A B B Ava 8 D C C Ella 8 B D C Julie 8 B A C Kate 6 D A A

Based on this data please do following two calculations -

1) Calculate Average Grade for each student using the following rules

Assign scores based on grades using following scale - A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, F=6

So if a student has got A in maths, B in science and B in English, then his average is calculated as (1 + 2 + 2)/ 3 = 1.67, on rounding its 2 so B.

In the report provided above, Oliver should have average as B, for Jack it’s B, for Charlie it’s D, for Harry it’s

E etc

2) Calculate the Age to Grade Correlation which is defined as -

For each age group, the most frequently occurring awarded grade in any subject, for any student in that age group. For example for age 5 years, the most frequently awarded grade is B, for 6 it’s A, for 7 it’s B, for 8 it’s A and for 9 it’s E.

Please write a java (preferably java 8) based project and send as a zip file. You can structure the project and model the input/output as you choose. You can make assumptions, which can be stated in comments. Code should be extensible, it should be fairly easy to add or remove subjects from the report
